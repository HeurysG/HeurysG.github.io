          <h2>Artifacts</h2>

          </ul>

          <h2>Project highlights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>SQL model with dimensions and facts for sportsbook economics.</li>
            <li>Behavior-based churn simulation with segment-level hazard logic.</li>
            <li>Promo offer framework with 4/13/26-week net profit, cost efficiency, and payback tracking.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What I was curious about</h2>
          <p>Sportsbooks look simple from the outside: people place bets, the book pays winners, and keeps the rest. But once you zoom in, profit can swing hard week to week. I wanted to understand what really drives those swings, and whether promotions such as bonus bets bring in valuable users over time or just add cost over time.</p>

          <h2>What I did</h2>
          <p>I used real NFL game outcomes and built a simulation of a betting ledger on top of them, so every simulated bet still settles against real game results. I set up a simple warehouse-style model (teams and events as dimensions, bets and costs as facts), then simulated different customer types, betting behavior, payouts, and promo usage. From there, I used SQL to calculate handle, gross profit, net profit, hold, and margin, and broke those down by market, time, and customer segment.</p>

          <h2>What I found</h2>
          <p>Profit is concentrated. A small share of markets and user groups explains most of the upside and most of the downside. Promotions can look misleading if you only read one metric, so I used a simple scorecard: post-period net profit, promo cost, ROI at 4/13/26 weeks, and a cumulative payback curve.</p>

          <h2>Why it matters</h2>
          <p>This is the type of work I want to do day to day: connect user activity to P&amp;L, explain what changed in plain English, and evaluate promos as an investment rather than a guess. The customer behavior is synthetic, so this is not claiming a real-world causal result. The point is to show how I structure the problem, build the analysis, and turn it into decisions.</p>

          <h2>Headline KPIs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Handle: <strong>$3.83M</strong></li>
            <li>Gross Profit: <strong>$185K</strong></li>
            <li>Net Profit: <strong>$77K</strong></li>
            <li>Hold: <strong>4.84%</strong></li>
            <li>Margin: <strong>2.02%</strong></li>
            <li>Promo net per user: <strong>-$2 -&gt; $19 -&gt; $28</strong> (4w/13w/26w)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Chart preview</h2>
          <p>Retention and promo economics outputs generated from the synthetic ledger.</p>

          <h3>Topline sportsbook economics</h3>
          <p>This snapshot summarizes handle, gross profit, key costs, and net profit so the P&amp;L story is clear before cohort analysis.</p>
          <span class="image fit"><img src="output/topline_economics_summary.png" alt="Topline sportsbook economics including handle, gross profit, costs, and net profit" /></span>

          <h3>Main retention view (who is still around)</h3>
          <p>This is the primary retention chart. It shows the share of each segment still active at day 7, day 30, day 60, and day 90.</p>
          <span class="image fit"><img src="output/retention_curve_by_segment.png" alt="Still-active retention by segment at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days" /></span>

          <h3>Supportive view: cumulative return by day 7/30/90</h3>
          <p>Cumulative return % means the share of users who came back at least once by that checkpoint, not users active exactly on that day.</p>

          <h3>Promo economics</h3>
          <p>Promo-tagged bets can be lower margin in isolation, while promo-exposed users can still become profitable over time through repeat non-promo activity.</p>
          <p>Promo spend is intentionally conservative in this base run. In higher-budget scenarios, we expect weaker near-term ROI and later payback, with the potential for stronger long-term retention and revenue if targeting quality remains high.</p>
          <span class="image fit"><img src="output/promo_pre_post_handle.png" alt="Promo pre versus post handle comparison" /></span>
          <p>The payback curve tracks cumulative net profit after promo costs by week since first promo exposure. In this run, the curve crosses break-even early and then stays positive at a slower slope, showing payback with more gradual long-tail gains.</p>

          <h2>Limitations</h2>
          <p>Customer and churn behavior are simulated, so outputs depend on model assumptions. In production, I would calibrate this against real event data and measure promo impact with randomized holdouts. I include this on purpose because good analysis should be clear about uncertainty.</p>
